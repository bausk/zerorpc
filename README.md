# zerorpc

A protocol (and Python implementation) for RPC over [ZeroMQ] which uses JSON for
data serialization. The resulting Python implementation is approx 5x faster than the 
corresponding xmlrpcserver & client in the single-threaded case, and nearly 10x faster in the
multithreaded case. It is simple to achieve over 10K RPC calls/sec with this implementation.

## Requirements

- [Python] tested with 2.7
- [ZeroMQ Python bindings]
- [UltraJson] but you can plug in your own JSON serializer/deserializer

[ZeroMQ Python bindings]: http://www.zeromq.org/bindings:python

## Example

### Server

Create an instance of ZeroRpcServer, register functions and/or class instances, and call start().
Functions can be referenced by different names and/or organized into dotted namespaces.

    def mult(a, b):
        return a * b

    server = zerorpc.server.ZeroRpcServer("tcp://*:5555")
    server.register_function(mult, name="my.namespace.mult")
    server.start(3, blocking=False)
    
### Client

Create an instance of ZeroRpcClient and call methods on it as if the functions were defined on that
instance. The call is marshaled to the server transparently. Exceptions on the server are propagated
to the client.  
    
    client = zerorpc.client.ZeroRpcClient("tcp://localhost:5555")
    result = client.my.namespace.mult(5, 7)

### MultiCall

MultiCall works similarly to the xmlrpclib implementation. The calls are marshaled to the server, and the
result is returned, in one network roundtrip.

    client = zerorpc.client.ZeroRpcClient("tcp://localhost:5555")
    multicall = zerorpc.client.MultiCall(client)
    multicall.my.namespace.mult(2, 2)
    multicall.my.namespace.mult(3, 3)
    multicall.my.namespace.mult(4, 4)
    for result in multicall():
        print result
        
## Example Benchmarks        

To run benchmarks on your own machine see the benchmarks subdirectory

I got these results on Win XP x64 edition, Intel Xeon CPU W3530 @ 2.80GHz, 12GB RAM

- xmlrpc  client & server (single-threaded):  850 calls/sec
- zerorpc client & server (single-threaded): 4500 calls/sec
- xmlrpc  client & server (multi-threaded):  1200 calls/sec
- zerorpc client & server (multi-threaded): 11000 calls/sec
